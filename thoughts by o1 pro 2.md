You’re right that one of the big advantages of rolling your own SVM in PyTorch is that you can transparently leverage a GPU ― something that vanilla `sklearn.svm.SVC` simply doesn’t do.  Here’s the trade‐off:

---

## 1. CPU‑only vs. GPU acceleration  

- **scikit‑learn’s `SVC`** is a C++/Fortran implementation of LibSVM under the hood. It’s highly optimized for the CPU (and can even spawn multiple threads via `n_jobs`), but it has **no GPU support**.  
- **PyTorch** by default will run all tensor operations on the CPU, too, unless you explicitly move your model and data to CUDA:  
  ```python
  device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
  X = X.to(device)
  y = y.to(device)
  w = w.to(device)
  b = b.to(device)
  ```
  Once everything lives on `device="cuda"`, all of your forward/backward passes and gradient updates happen on the GPU, which can be orders of magnitude faster for large batches.

---

## 2. “Is GPU‑accelerated PyTorch always faster?”  

1. **Data size & batch strategy**  
   - If your dataset is small (5,000 × D), the overhead of copying data back and forth between CPU↔GPU and launching CUDA kernels can actually **slow you down**.  
   - For larger data or very big feature sets, GPUs shine: larger matrix multiplications and hinge‐loss gradients scale nicely.  

2. **Solver differences**  
   - `sklearn.svm.SVC` uses an SMO/QP solver that’s extremely efficient for medium‑sized problems.  
   - Your PyTorch loop is doing SGD (or mini‑batch GD) on a non‑smooth hinge loss, which may need many epochs for convergence.  Even on GPU, it can be slower if you haven’t tuned learning‐rates, batch‑sizes, or early stopping.

## 3. Tips to get GPU speed in your PyTorch SVM  

1. **Data & model on CUDA**  
   ```python
   device = torch.device("cuda")
   X, y = X.to(device), y.to(device)
   w = torch.zeros(D, requires_grad=True, device=device)
   b = torch.zeros(1, requires_grad=True, device=device)
   ```

2. **Use mini‑batch SGD** rather than full‑batch.  E.g.:  
   ```python
   from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
   ds = TensorDataset(X, y)
   loader = DataLoader(ds, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)
   opt = torch.optim.SGD([w,b], lr=1e-2, weight_decay=0)
   for epoch in range(epochs):
       for xb, yb in loader:
           f = xb @ w + b
           hinge = torch.clamp(1 - yb*f, min=0).mean()
           loss = 0.5*(w@w) + C*hinge
           opt.zero_grad(); loss.backward(); opt.step()
   ```

3. **Mixed precision** (optional)  
   If you have an Amp‑capable GPU, you can use PyTorch’s `autocast` + `GradScaler` to do half‑precision, which can further increase throughput.

---

## 4. If you still want an out‐of‐the‐box GPU SVM  

- **RAPIDS cuML** (NVIDIA) has a GPU‑accelerated `cuml.SVC` API that mirrors scikit‑learn’s:  
  ```python
  from cuml.svm import SVC as cuSVC
  gsvc = cuSVC(kernel="linear", C=1.0)
  gsvc.fit(X_gpu, y_gpu)
  ```
- **ThunderSVM** is another drop‑in GPU library for SVMs.  

---

### Bottom line  
- **Yes**, your PyTorch implementation can be faster *if* you move tensors & optimizer to the GPU and choose sensible batch sizes/learning rates.  
- But remember: for moderate data sizes, scikit‑learn’s C++ SMO solver on multi‑core CPUs is *extremely* fast and will often beat a naïve SGD‑based SVM, even if the latter is on GPU.  
- If you need high performance *and* don’t want to hand‑tune PyTorch, try a GPU‑enabled SVM like cuML or ThunderSVM instead.

I implemented everything by hand using torch, won't this accelerate since scikit-learn uses cpu?
