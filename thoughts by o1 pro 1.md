Let’s untangle your pipeline step by step—both the math and the “why” behind each stage—and then see where an SVC does or doesn’t add value.

---

## 1. Data preprocessing & feature encoding  
Before any clustering or classification, make sure all 20‑plus features live in a common “space”:  
1. **Numerical features** (e.g. closing price, volume, export/domestic ratio, ownership concentration) → standardize to zero mean, unit variance.  
2. **Ordinal terciles** (company size, valuation) → you can encode them as 0/1/2 or via one‑hot if you want to let clusters treat each tercile independently.  
3. **Pure categoricals** (industry, board, SOE vs. private, ST status, multi‑listing) → one‑hot encoding.  

That gives you an \(N\times D\) numeric matrix ready for clustering.

---

## 2. K‑means clustering  
You’ve already run an elbow plot to pick \(k\).  K‑means will partition the data so that within‑cluster sum of squares is minimized.  The result is:  
\[
\{\,C_1,\dots,C_k\},\quad C_j = \{\,i : \ell_i = j\}
\]
where \(\ell_i\in\{1,\dots,k\}\) is the cluster label of stock \(i\).  

You’ll use these cluster labels downstream in CAPM to define your “market portfolio” for each group.

---

## 3. CAPM per cluster  
For each cluster \(j\), define the cluster’s return series  
\[
R_{m,j,t} = \frac1{|C_j|}\sum_{i\in C_j} R_{i,t},
\]
or, better, a value‐weighted version if you want larger‐cap names to count more.  Then for each stock \(i\in C_j\) run the time‐series regression  
\[
R_{i,t} - R_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i\,(R_{m,j,t}-R_f) + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\]
via OLS (e.g. `statsmodels.OLS`).  The stocks with the highest \(\alpha\) (positive idiosyncratic return) may be your “winners,” and \(\beta\) tells you their sensitivity.

---

## 4. Where does an SVC come in?  
### a) What SVC learns  
A (linear) SVC finds a hyperplane  
\[
w^\top x + b = 0
\]
that best separates your \(k\) clusters in feature‑space, using the *signed distance*  
\[
\text{dist}(x_i) = \frac{w^\top x_i + b}{\|w\|}.
\]  
For a one‑vs‑one scheme on \(k\) clusters, you train \(\tfrac{k(k-1)}2\) binary SVMs, each seeing only points from two clusters.

### b) Do you *need* it?  
- **If your sole goal** is to *define* clusters and then run CAPM, **NO**—K‑means labels are already your grouping.  
- **If you want** a *classifier* that:  
  1. **Explains** how to assign *new* stocks into one of your \(k\) clusters,  
  2. Provides *interpretable* linear boundaries in feature‑space,  
  
  then training an SVC on your existing \((X,\ell)\) makes sense.

> **But** if you train on the same data and immediately re‑predict on it, you’ll recover the same labels (or very close)—you’re simply approximating your K‑means decision boundaries with an SVM.

### c) Workflow options  
1. **No SVC**:  
   - Cluster once → CAPM → stock ranking.  
2. **Cluster + SVC for new data**:  
   - Run K‑means on your 5,000 stocks → get \(\ell_i\).  
   - Fit \(\texttt{SVC(kernel='linear')}\) on \((X, \ell)\).  
   - For any *future* stock (or cross‑validation fold), encode its features → \(\hat\ell = \text{SVC.predict}(x)\) → drop into the right CAPM group.  
3. **Iterative refinement (rare)**:  
   - You could label by SVC, recluster inside each SVC‐defined slice, etc., but this generally only adds complexity if you suspect K‑means mis‐partitions your space.

---

## 5. Math of the linear SVC  
1. **Decision function & signed distance**  
   \[
   f(x) = w^\top x + b,\quad \text{dist}(x) = \frac{f(x)}{\|w\|}.
   \]  
2. **Hinge loss** for a single point \((x_i,y_i)\) with labels \(y_i\in\{-1,+1\}\):  
   \[
   L_{\text{hinge}}(w,b) = \max\{0,\;1 - y_i f(x_i)\}.
   \]  
3. **Primal objective** (over all data):  
   \[
   J(w,b) = \frac12\|w\|^2 + C\sum_i L_{\text{hinge}}(w,b).
   \]  
4. **Gradient steps**  
   - If \(1 - y_if(x_i) > 0\):  
     \[
     \nabla_w = w - C\,y_i\,x_i,\quad \nabla_b = -C\,y_i.
     \]  
   - Else (no loss):  
     \[
     \nabla_w = w,\quad \nabla_b = 0.
     \]  
   And you apply SGD (or a full‐batch method) to minimize.

## 6. Libraries & code suggestions  
- **For clustering**:  
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
  from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
  pipeline = Pipeline([
      ("encode", ColumnTransformer([...numeric, ...categorical...])),
      ("kmeans", KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42))
  ])
  labels = pipeline.fit_predict(df)
  ```
- **For SVC** (no need to implement gradient by hand unless for pedagogy):  
  ```python
  from sklearn.svm import SVC
  svc = SVC(kernel="linear", decision_function_shape="ovo", C=1.0)
  svc.fit(X_train, labels)
  labels_pred = svc.predict(X_train)  # will match labels_train up to small errors
  ```
- **If you really want PyTorch** (and autograd) to fiddle with hinge loss manually:  
  ```python
  import torch
  X = torch.tensor(X_np, dtype=torch.float32)
  y = torch.tensor(y_np, dtype=torch.float32)   # ±1
  w = torch.zeros(D, requires_grad=True)
  b = torch.zeros(1, requires_grad=True)
  optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([w, b], lr=0.01)
  for epoch in range(epochs):
      f = X @ w + b
      hinge = torch.clamp(1 - y*f, min=0)
      loss = 0.5*torch.dot(w,w) + C * hinge.mean()
      optimizer.zero_grad()
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()
  ```

---

## 7. A more unified alternative  
If you’re juggling mixed numeric/categorical data and want “soft” clusters, you might explore **Gaussian Mixture Models** or **K‑prototypes** (handles mixed data directly).  Or even **hierarchical clustering** with a Gower distance for mixed types.  But if K‑means is working for you, stick with it.

---

### Bottom‑line recommendations  
- **Skip SVC** unless you need to *classify new stocks* into your clusters.  
- If you do want a classifier, use **scikit‑learn’s `SVC(kernel='linear', decision_function_shape='ovo')`**—it handles all the math, distances, hinge‐loss and gradient‐descent under the hood.  
- Your CAPM step naturally uses the *raw cluster labels*; you don’t “re‑label” with SVC unless new data show up later.  

Feel free to ask for code snippets on any of these steps!







input:
I'm now working on a project, I have plans and I still have some problems with some of the logics:

1. I have a 5000 by 20-some matrix of data, features containing their Closing Price, volume, 出口业务额/国内业务额, 公司规模（按公司市值排序，前1/3，中，后）
行业大类（服务业/工业/传统农林牧渔）
上市板块（主版、创业板、科创板）
公司估值（按市盈率，前1/3、中、后）
国资还是私营（看“法人”是否为国家单位）
股权集中度（第一大股东持股比例）
是否ST
小盘股（流通市值100亿以下）中、大（500以上）
是否在多地上市（在国外或港股上市）2. The goal is to classify them into different categories, with clusterring standards output for later analysis, then use CAPM, R_m being the average of that categories, and R_i being every single one stock from the category it belongs to, to find the optimal stock with highest alpha and beta. 
3. The plan is to use k means cluster first, to do a unsupervised learning, then use the label it got, to train a svc with ovo, basically using svc to try to better classify the data, then use capm to analyze it.
3. I now have already implemented a k means cluster with elbow plot to find it's best k
4. Also have already implemented a simple CAPM using statsmodel OLS, to get each regression line for each stock and it's corresponding market portfolio.
5. But when I'm trying to implement the SVC, I encountered some problems thought wise:

Problems:
1. What is the matrix calculation to calculate the signed distances from an n point to hyperplain?
2. Is the mathematical logic basically do signed distances to get a distances matrix for each data point, then use hinge loss to calculate for a single iteration the corresponding weights and bias's loss, and use gradient descent to minimize it by calculate the negative gradient multiple time? 
3. I also encountered some of the problems code wise, I think I can understand the process if I was to calculate it with my hand, but doing that with code would be probably inefficient, so which library do you suggest I use for gradient related work in pytorch? If you can recommand some must-use libraries or functions for torch-related or gradient-related work.
4. I have some problems with understanding the whole process as well: Since the k means cluster will classify the data, aka giving labels for each data points, will svc be neccecery? and if I want to use svc/ovo in this sceanario, do I train the svc/ovo with all the data with each of it's k means cluster labeled labels? or do i just train the svc first with the labels, then remove the labels and use trained svc/ovo to relabel the data? what's the play here? and if I do that, won't that just label the things exactly the same? since the svc was trained on it?
Please correct me if something I said was wrong and/or has better way to do it. If there's a better approch, you have to explain thoroughly.
