# To do list

1. CAPM algorithms
2. Get the data
3. Culculate Euclidien Distance
4. K means clustering to get labels for svm
5. SVM using pytorch algorithm, this draws the line for binary classification
6. OVO using pytorch algorithm, do one by one voting system, this uses the SVM function for each 2 clusters clustered by the k means cluster
7. (Optional) if the data is not linearly seperatable by svm, inplement kernel tricks using polynomial or other method to seperate it.
8. Choose class index as risk free rate then calculate alpha and beta for each stock within the class
9. Evaluate combinations
