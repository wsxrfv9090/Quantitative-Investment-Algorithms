# To do list

- [ ] CAPM algorithms
- [ ] Get the data
- [ ] Culculate Euclidien Distance
- [ ] K means clustering to get labels for svm
- [ ] SVM using pytorch algorithm, this draws the line for binary classification
- [ ] OVO using pytorch algorithm, do one by one voting system, this uses the SVM function for each 2 clusters clustered by the k means cluster
- [ ] (Optional) if the data is not linearly seperatable by svm, inplement kernel tricks using polynomial or other method to seperate it.
- [ ] Choose class index as risk free rate then calculate alpha and beta for each stock within the class
- [ ] Evaluate combinations
