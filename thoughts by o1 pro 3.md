Below is a deep‐dive into what you gain—and what you don’t—by wrapping your K‑means clusters inside a linear SVC (with one‑vs‑one voting), followed by a hands‑on, **objective** recipe for measuring “better” without relying on gut feel.

## 1. What K‑means + SVC/OVO *actually* is

1. **K‑means**  
   - Unsupervised partitioning: minimizes within‑cluster variance.  
   - Output: a label ℓᵢ∈{1…k} for each point xᵢ, and centroids μ₁…μₖ.

2. **Linear SVC (ovo)**  
   - You take the *labels* ℓᵢ from K‑means, then train a linear SVM in a one‑vs‑one scheme.  
   - For each pair of clusters (j, m) you fit a binary classifier, then at predict‑time you vote among the k(k−1)/2 classifiers to reassign any x to one of k classes.  

> **Net effect:** the SVC learns a piecewise‑linear shortcut to reproduce your K‑means decision boundaries—and can be applied to new data much faster than rerunning K‑means.

## 2. Logical pros & cons

| Aspect                          | K‑means alone                                    | K‑means + SVC/OVO                                        |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Boundary flexibility**        | Voronoi cells around centroids (non‐linear w.r.t features if you one‐hot encode) | Approximates boundaries as hyperplanes between clusters |
| **Speed of assigning new points** | You must compute distances to *all* k centroids (O(kD)) | A single matrix‐vector multiplication + voting (O(k²D)) |
| **Interpretability**            | Hard to write down “why x went to cluster 3” beyond “it’s closest centroid.” | Each SVC hyperplane has weight w⁽j,m⁾ — you can inspect feature‐importance for every pair. |
| **Robustness to noise**         | Sensitive: a noisy centroid can pull in far‑away points | SVC margins can offer some robustness (hinge‐loss margin) |
| **Computational cost**          | Offline: K‑means is O(NkD × iter). Online: O(kD) per point. | Offline: +O(N²D) to train k(k−1)/2 SVMs (worst case). Online: O(k²D) per point. |
| **Cluster “quality”**           | As good as your k and initialization allow.      | **Cannot** improve the *intrinsic* clustering—you only approximate it. |

**Key takeaway:** unless you need  
1. **Fast, repeated assignments** for streaming or thousands of new stocks,  
2. **Linear decision rules** for explainability,  
3. **Margin‐based robustness** to borderline points,  

then adding an SVC is extra complexity *without* improving the original clusters.

## 3. When—and why—SVC helps

1. **Out‑of‑sample assignment**  
   - If you plan to score new IPOs or daily rebalances, you’ll avoid rerunning K‑means on an ever‑growing universe.  
2. **Feature‐level insights**  
   - You get one weight vector w⁽j,m⁾ per pair of clusters—telling you which financial features matter most to distinguish, say, “high‐cap tech” vs. “mid‐cap industrial.”  
3. **Margin‐based filtering**  
   - You can ask: how many stocks lie within the margin (|w·x+b|/‖w‖<1)?  Those are the “uncertain” ones you might treat differently.

## 4. Pros & Cons summary

### ✅ Pros of K‑means + SVC/OVO  
- **Ultra‑fast inference** on new data.  
- **Linear interpretability** via hyperplane weights.  
- **Margin scores** let you flag borderline cases.

### ❌ Cons  
- **No boost** to *training‑set* cluster quality.  
- **Extra tuning** (C‐parameter, decision function shape).  
- **More compute** to train O(k²) many SVMs if k is large.

## 5. An **objective** performance recipe

Rather than “it feels better,” choose a couple of **quantitative metrics**:

| Metric                       | What it measures                              | Higher = better?      |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Silhouette score**         | (bᵢ – aᵢ)/max(aᵢ,bᵢ): cohesion vs. separation  | Yes                   |
| **Davies‑Bouldin index**     | Avg. (σᵢ+σⱼ)/‖μᵢ–μⱼ‖ over clusters             | **Lower** = better    |
| **Classification accuracy**  | For SVC: fraction of points whose SVC label = K‑means label (on hold‑out) | Yes |
| **Normalized MI**            | Mutual info. between two labelings            | Higher = more agreement|

### Step‑by‑step

1. **Split** your N stocks into a train and test set (e.g. 80/20).  
2. **Train K‑means** on the *train* features → get ℓₜᵣₐᵢₙ.  
3. **Compute** internal clustering metrics **on train**:  
   - `silhouette_score(X_train, ℓ_train)`  
   - `davies_bouldin_score(X_train, ℓ_train)`  
4. **Fit SVC(ovo)**:  
   ```python
   svc = SVC(kernel="linear", decision_function_shape="ovo")
   svc.fit(X_train, ℓ_train)
   ```  
5. **Evaluate on test**:  
   - **K‑means assign**: `ℓ_km_test = kmeans.predict(X_test)`  
   - **SVC assign**:    `ℓ_svc_test = svc.predict(X_test)`  
   - Compute  
     - `silhouette_score(X_test, ℓ_km_test)` vs. `silhouette_score(X_test, ℓ_svc_test)`  
     - `davies_bouldin_score(X_test, ℓ_km_test)` vs. `…(X_test, ℓ_svc_test)`  
     - **Accuracy** = `accuracy_score(ℓ_km_test, ℓ_svc_test)`  
     - **NMI**    = `normalized_mutual_info_score(ℓ_km_test, ℓ_svc_test)`  

> **Interpretation**  
> - If SVC’s silhouette on test is *higher*, its linear boundary actually *improves* cohesion/separation compared to simple nearest‑centroid.  
> - High SVC accuracy (> 95 %) and NMI (~ 1.0) mean it faithfully reproduces K‑means (good for fast inference).  
> - If accuracy is low, your clusters aren’t linearly separable—maybe stick with pure K‑means or try a **kernel SVM**.

### 6. Concrete next steps

1. **Implement the above** with scikit‑learn metrics.  
2. **Compare** K‑means vs. SVC boundaries by looking at silhouette & DB indices.  
3. **Decide**:  
   - If SVC under‑performs (lower silhouette, much lower accuracy), skip it.  
   - If it *matches* or *beats* K‑means in cohesion/separation *and* runs faster in production, embed it.

This framework removes subjectivity: you’ll pick the pipeline that scores best on well‐defined, numeric criteria.
